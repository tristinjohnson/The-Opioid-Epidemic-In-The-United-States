# The-Opioid-Epidemic-In-The-United-States

I will be doing a complete analysis about the opioid epidemic across the United States of America from 1999-2018. Throughout this presentation, I will be covering various analytics across several factors regarding the opioid epidemic in the United States, which include total deaths by opioids, the specific total deaths by opioid, the gender figures in absolute and relative figures, the youth deaths by opioids, the rate of deaths by demographic, and finally comparing the deaths due to opioid by race with the average household income by race.
